**ACCUMULATOR AND REGISTER A or ACC Register**
===============================

Description 
-------

The ACC Register must perform logical functions such as "AND", "OR" or "OR EXCLUSIVE" and stores the data (input and results) for the operations in UAL; the accumulator is one of the main elements that define the computer's word length - the word length is equal to the accumulator's length.
