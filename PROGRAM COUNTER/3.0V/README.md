Program Counter
===============================

Description 
-------

A program counter is a register in a computer processor that contains the address (location) of the instruction currently being executed. As each instruction is fetched, the program counter increases its stored value by 1. After each instruction is fetched, the program counter points to the next instruction in the sequence. When the computer is restarted or reset, the program counter normally resets to 0.

In computing, a program is a specific set of ordered operations for a computer to perform. An instruction is an order given to a computer processor by a program. Inside a computer, an address is a specific location in memory or storage. A register is part of a small set of data storage locations that the processor uses.

Some engineers refer to a program counter as an instruction address register or an address pointer.
