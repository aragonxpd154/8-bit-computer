**ASTABLE AND MONOSTABLE CLOCK CIRCUIT**
===============================

Description 
-------

An astable multivibrator is an electronic circuit that has two states, but neither is stable. The circuit therefore behaves like an oscillator. The time spent in each state is controlled by charging or discharging a capacitor through a resistor.

A monostable multivibrator is a circuit that has two states, only one of which is stable.

The circuit can be put into an unstable state via an input signal. The time the circuit can be in an unstable state is usually controlled by charging or discharging a capacitor through a resistor.
