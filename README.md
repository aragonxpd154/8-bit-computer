**COMPUTER 8 BITS**
===============================

This is a small 8-bit computer that I'm developing with a bus and some basic peripherals, with little use in the current technological context, it's a more hobbyist and simplistic project like many projects that exist on the internet.

No SoC's or microcontrollers, everything will be done like the old days without microcontrollers like Z80 or Atmega! The goal is to create a computer as abstract as possible, for educational purposes, however nothing prevents it from being used in production.
